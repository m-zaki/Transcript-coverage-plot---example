## Drawing a 5' to 3' transcript plot

Often in RNA-seq data we would be interested to examine if there are any bias in the coverage across a transcript. 

![Example of 5' to 3' bias found in RNA-seq](figures/nrg2484-f3.jpg)

This R script shows hows how to draw such a plot and examine if such bias is present in our datasets.


```{r}
# Generate example coverage data for gene1 (g1)
g1 <- round(
  c(rnorm(866, mean=100),
    rnorm(11, mean=70),
    rnorm(30, mean=10),
    rnorm(7, mean=45),
    rnorm(30, mean=0, sd=0),
    rnorm(56, mean=5)))

length(g1)
```

The coverage data has `r length(g1)` values, but for plotting puropses we would not draw a plot of all `r length(g1)` base pair. Instead we would like to  *bin* the value into 100 sections. The example below illustrates the point.

`g1` has `r length(g1)` data points and we now would like to divide the data into 100 bins. So how do we achive a bin something like below? 


bin1. 1-10  
bin2. 11-20  
bin3. 21-30  
bin4. 31-40  
bin5. ...  
bin97. ...  
bin98. 971-980  
bin99. 981-990  
bin100. 991-1000  


```{r}
# Lets use a script to do the binning process 
# We use the library binr
# Bining the coverage into 100 bins
library(binr)
binfunc <- bins(1:length(g1), target.bins = 100, max.breaks = 100)
```

Lets examine the output of binr function, especially from *binct* object

```{r}
binlength <- as.numeric(binfunc$binct) 
length(binlength) # Generates 100 bins
head(binfunc$binct) # Each individual bin contains 10 values
tail(binfunc$binct)
```

The *binct* object generates 100 bins as specified by the *target.bins* parameter and for each bin, it contains 10 data points. Now, lets assign the orignal coverage values to thier corresponding bins, for example ;

```{r}
g1[1:10]  # Belongs to bin 1
g1[11:20] # Belongs to bin 2
g1[21:30] # Belongs to bin 3
# and so forth
```

Individualy we would do something like this ;

```{r}
bin1 <- rep("bin1", each=binlength[1])
bin2 <- rep("bin2", each=binlength[1])
```


```{r}
# Lets do it in a loop
# Create a category of the bin
binlist <- list()
for (i in seq_along(binlength)){
  binlist[[i]] <-  rep(i, each=binlength[i])
}
bincateg <- unlist(binlist)
```

Lets combine the orignal `g1` coverage data and the bin category into a data.frame
```{r}
# Data frame containing the coverage and the bin it belongs to
df_cov <- data.frame(value = g1,
                     bin = bincateg)

```


Lets get the mean coverage for each bin

```{r}
# Get the mean of each bin
library(dplyr)
df_bin <- as.data.frame(group_by(df_cov, bin) %>% 
                          summarise(mean_cov = mean(value)))
dim(df_bin)
```


Finally draw the plot with ggplot2

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df_bin, aes(x=bin, y=mean_cov)) +
  geom_line() + 
  ylab("Read count") +
  xlab("5' to 3' coverage")
```
